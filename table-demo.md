## **Comparison of Epidemiological Study Designs**

Epidemiological studies have different **strengths** and **weaknesses** depending on the research question. Below is a comparison of common study types.

| Study Type            | Strengths                                      | Weaknesses                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Cohort Study**      | Measures incidence, establishes temporality  | Expensive, time-consuming                      |
| **Case-Control Study** | Good for rare diseases, quick and cost-effective | Prone to recall bias, cannot determine causality |
| **Cross-Sectional Study** | Easy and inexpensive, generates hypotheses | Cannot establish causality, no temporality |
| **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)** | Gold standard for causality, minimizes bias | Expensive, ethical concerns |
