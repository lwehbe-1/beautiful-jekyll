study_types:
  Cohort Study:
    description: "Observational study following a group over time."
    strengths:
      - Measures incidence
      - Establishes temporality (cause before effect)
    weaknesses:
      - Expensive
      - Time-consuming
  Case-Control Study:
    description: "Compares individuals with a disease (cases) to those without (controls)."
    strengths:
      - Good for rare diseases
      - Quick and cost-effective
    weaknesses:
      - Prone to recall bias
      - Cannot determine causality
  Cross-Sectional Study:
    description: "Analyzes data from a population at a single point in time."
    strengths:
      - Easy and inexpensive to conduct
      - Generates hypotheses
    weaknesses:
      - Cannot establish causality
      - No temporality (cause-effect relationship unclear)
  Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):
    description: "Participants are randomly assigned to groups to test interventions."
    strengths:
      - Gold standard for causal relationships
      - Minimizes selection bias
    weaknesses:
      - Expensive and time-consuming
      - Ethical concerns in some cases
