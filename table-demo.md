study_types:
  Cohort:
    description: "Observational study following a group over time."
    strengths:
      - Measures incidence
      - Establishes temporality
    weaknesses:
      - Expensive
      - Time-consuming
  Case-Control:
    description: "Compares individuals with a disease to those without."
    strengths:
      - Good for rare diseases
      - Quick and inexpensive
    weaknesses:
      - Prone to recall bias
      - Cannot establish causality
  Cross-Sectional:
    description: "Analyzes data from a population at a single point in time."
    strengths:
      - Easy to conduct
      - Generates hypotheses
    weaknesses:
      - Cannot establish causality
      - No temporality
  RCT:
    description: "Participants are randomly assigned to groups to test interventions."
    strengths:
      - Gold standard for causality
      - Minimizes bias
    weaknesses:
      - Expensive
      - Ethical concerns
